# ClientsApi

API developed to provide clients control to an e-comerce website.
Technology adopted:
- Asp.net webapi 2 (REST services)
- Entity Framework 6 (persistence/ORM)
- Ninject (dependency injection)
- Moq (unit tests mocking framework)

Business properties:
- All clients must have a valid CPF;
- Client can have several phone numbers;
- All data is mandatory.

### Extra:
In the TestPage folder, there is a webpage that allows to test the API.

The test page uses jquery ajax functions to call the REST services.

In order to accomplish this test, it was necessary install CORS (enable cross-origin) package in the project.
